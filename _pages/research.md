### Working papers

- **Honor, Goal Setting, and Energy Conservation** (with Botao Qin and Siyuan Xie)
[**[PDF]**](/papers/Honor_and_goal(1).pdf) 

   <details style="font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width =20%;">  <summary style="color:blue; font-family:courier; font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> Abstract </summary>As Schelling conjectured, domestic political constraints affect the outcomes of negotiations over international public goods, e.g., greenhouse gas mitigation. Current literature suggests both total contributions (home plus foreign country) and home country contributions in a Presidential system subject to a Senate ratification constraint (e.g., U.S.) never exceed those under a home country without domestic constraints (e.g., authoritarian regime like China).  Herein we show how this result is reversed by adding another realistic constraint to the Presidential system—a re-election constraint.  We find that total contributions and home country contributions with both constraints can exceed those under a system without any domestic constraints. </details>

- **Context-dependence Preference for Climate Change Mitigation --- the Role of Temperature, Information, and Unprecedented floods** (with Botao Qin and Cristian Rojas)
[**[PDF]**](/papers/Reference_point_climate_change(1).pdf) 
    <details style="font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width =20%;">  <summary style="color:blue; font-family:courier; font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> Abstract </summary>The experimental valuation literature has found that people’s preferences are context-dependent. This paper examines the effects of three different contexts—weather seasons, information, and an unprecedented flooding event—on people’s preference for climate change mitigation. We conducted an online choice experiment in China in both warm and cool seasons.  We also explored whether providing information on climate change consequences  and an unprecedented flooding event  would affect this valuation. Using a mixed logit model and Poe test, we found no significant treatment effects of seasons and information for most of the attributes except for ‘frequency of typhoons’ and ‘costs’. However, we find that when provided with information, respondents’ Willingness to Pay (WTP) for climate change mitigation in general is significantly higher during the cool season than the warm season. In addition, in the warm season, providing information on climate change consequences reduces the WTP for climate change mitigation in general. However, during the cool season, providing information on climate change consequences increases respondents’ WTP for reducing the duration of heatwaves and decreasing biodiversity loss. Finally, we found that the unprecedented flooding event did not change participants’ valuation of climate change mitigation when provided with information on climate change consequences. </details>    

- **Corporate Governance, Electricity Restructuring, and Pollution Abatement Investment** (with Ben Gilbert and Klaas van 't Veld)
[**[PDF]**](/papers/charlie_jmp.pdf) 
    <details style="font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width =20%;">  <summary style="color:blue; font-family:courier; font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> Abstract </summary>This paper aims to answer whether the strength of corporate governance, relative to a firm’s financial structure and regulatory environment, affects its cost of capital for abatement investment aimed at complying with environmental regulation. Specifically, we study the U.S. electricity industry’s compliance with a major U.S. emissions trading program. We find that two of three well-known governance indices have no relationship to the implied cost of abatement capital. For the one index that does show a relationship, results suggest that limiting shareholder power—rather than giving shareholders more power—may reduce the cost of capital. These results are on contrary to the conventional wisdom that “the most important benefit of good governance is to raise capital at better terms” (Doidge et al., 2007). These also imply that investor activism aimed at improving firms’ corporate governance might impede their environmental progress. That is, ESG investing might have goals that are in conflict with each other. We also find that the impacts of a firm’s corporate governance on its cost of capital depend on the electricity restructuring status of plants the company owns. Improving governance raises the cost of capital for abatement investment in deregulated plants but has no significant impacts on regulated plants. This is consistent with the fact that regulated plants are allowed to recover capital costs through raising electricity prices, and are thus less dependent on governance quality to raise capital. </details>    
   

- **Are Teams Conditional Cooperators: Evidence from a Public Goods Experiment** (with Tongzhe Li)
[**[PDF]**](/papers/JMP_group_social_norm.pdf) 
     <details style="font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width =20%;">  <summary style="color:blue; font-family:courier; font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> Abstract </summary>  We study whether teams are conditional cooperators in a one-shot public goods game and to what extent this conditionality differs from that when the decisions are made by individuals. We find teams under a majority rule do not exhibit significantly different levels of conditionally cooperative behavior than individuals in isolation. In addition, when a team representative makes a decision for the whole team, it exhibits... we find teams under a random representative rule are less conditionally cooperative than teams under a majority rule. This result implies majority rule enhances conditional cooperation compared to a random representative rule. This thereby may lead to more prosocial outcomes which is indeed what our experiment finds. </details>
