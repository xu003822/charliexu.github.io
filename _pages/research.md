- **Corporate Governance, Electricity Restructuring, and Pollution Abatement Investment**, with Ben Gilbert and Klaas van 't Veld
[**[PDF]**](/papers/charlie_jmp.pdf) 
    <details style="font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width =20%;">  <summary style="color:blue; font-family:courier; font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> Abstract </summary>A firm’s cost of raising financial capital is important to its pollution abatement investment decisions and in turn to its environmental performance. The rapid growth
in investor efforts to influence firms’ Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
profiles has renewed interest in the extent to which investor preferences and oversight
can affect firms’ cost of capital. The ability of investors to directly influence firm-level
decisions, however, depends on the corporate governance mechanisms in place—the
provisions that determine the relative control rights of shareholders compared to those
of managers. In this paper, we aim to answer whether the strength of corporate governance, relative to a firm’s financial structure and regulatory environment, affects its cost of capital for abatement investment aimed at complying with environmental regulation. Specifically, we study the U.S. electricity industry’s compliance with a major U.S. emissions trading program. We find that two of three well-known governance indices have no relationship to the implied cost of abatement capital. For the one index that does show a relationship, results suggest that limiting shareholder power—rather
than giving shareholders more power—may reduce the cost of capital. These results
are on contrary to the conventional wisdom that “the most important benefit of good
governance is to raise capital at better terms” (Doidge et al., 2007). These also imply
that investor activism aimed at improving firms’ corporate governance might impede
their environmental progress. That is, ESG investing might have goals that are in conflict with each other. We also find that the impacts of a firm’s corporate governance on its cost of capital depend on the electricity restructuring status of plants the company owns. Improving governance raises the cost of capital for abatement investment in deregulated plants but has no significant impacts on regulated plants. This is consistent with the fact that regulated plants are allowed to recover capital costs through raising electricity prices, and are thus less dependent on governance quality to raise capital. </details>    
   

- **Are Teams Conditional Cooperators: Evidence from a Public Goods Experiment** (with Tongzhe Li)
[**[PDF]**](/papers/Alam_JMP_Oct21.pdf) 
     <details style="font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width =20%;">  <summary style="color:blue; font-family:courier; font-size:80%; font-family:Verdana; width=80%;"> Abstract </summary>  We study whether teams are conditional cooperators in a one-shot public goods game and to what
extent this conditionality differs from that when the decisions are made by individuals. We find
teams under a majority rule do not exhibit significantly different levels of conditionally cooperative
behavior than individuals in isolation. In addition, when a team representative makes a decision
for the whole team, it exhibits... we find teams under a random representative rule are less condi-
tionally cooperative than teams under a majority rule. This result implies majority rule enhances
conditional cooperation compared to a random representative rule. This thereby may lead to more
prosocial outcomes which is indeed what our experiment finds. </details>
