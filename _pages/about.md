Hi! Welcome to my website! I am proud that I have a famous name twin at [Princeton](https://www.math.princeton.edu/people/chenyang-xu).

I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at the [Department of Economics, University of Massachusetts Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/fahss/economics/). I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [University of Wyoming](https://www.uwyo.edu/economics/index.html).  I am an environmental economist, with research interests in designing and evaluating politically feasible and less intrusive instruments that promote environmental protection. These instruments include both traditional pricing mechanisms and behavioral tools. Additionally, I am also interested in developing innovative financing instruments that encourage green activities. If you have similar interests, please feel free to reach out. Maybe we could collaborate.

Besides being at my office cracking the dismal science, I particularly enjoy fishing, mountain biking, playing racquetball, and road trips.

For more details on my work please see my [Research page](https://xu003822.github.io/research/).

**Research Fields:**
  Environmental Economics, Behavioral and Experimental Economics, Development Economics, and Applied Econometrics.
